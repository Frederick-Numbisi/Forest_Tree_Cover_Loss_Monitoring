### Forest_Tree_Cover_Loss_Monitoring

The clearing of forest is considered an important source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a contributor to the radiative forces that drive climate change. According to The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines for estimating sectoral GHG emission and removal, forest is a constituent of the AFOLU Sector. The Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector is believed to be the most important source of carbon emission from land use in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We employ existing data on Global Forest Cover Change (following Hansen et. al. 2013) to estimate trends in tree cover and forest cover loss within the project area. We quantify the gross forest and tree cover loss from 2001 to 2021 using the Landsat-derived tree canopy cover (at reference year of 2000 - canopy closure for all vegetation taller than 5m observable at a 30m spatial resolution) and the tree cover loss in the following years up to 2021.
